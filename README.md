The video recording of the app is in this file. 

The demand was to change the voice (gender-wise) when the 'speak' button is pressed,
but unfortunately, TTS Package doesn't provide the audios on gender-basis for Android. 
It does it for iOS. Here is a paragraph taken from their documentation.

// Each voice is a Map containing at least these keys: name, locale
// - Windows (UWP voices) only: gender, identifier
// - iOS, macOS only: quality, gender, identifier
// - Android only: quality, latency, network_required
